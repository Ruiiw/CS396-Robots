# Evolutionary-Robot

This project is a Northwestern University CS396 (Artificial Life) assignment based on Ludobots tutorial. To run the program, install Python-based physics engine pybullet, and then run the command "python3 search.py" to generate simulations of snake-like creatures. 

Each simulation displays a snake with a random number of randomly shaped body parts, some of which get sensor neurons. Those body parts with sensors are colored green.
